# Target-Specific Siamese Attention Network for Real-time Object Tracking
## IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security - 2019


## Abstract 
Deep similarity trackers are able to track above realtime speed. However, their accuracy is considerably lower than
deep classification based trackers since they avoid valuable online
cues. To feed the target-specific information for real-time object
tracking, we propose a novel Siamese attention network. Different
types of attention mechanisms are used to capture different
contexts of target information and then learned knowledge is used
to feed target cues at different representation levels of similarity
tracking. In addition, an online learning mechanism is employed
to utilise the available target-specific data. The proposed tracker
reduces the impact of noise in the target template and improves
the accuracy of similarity tracking by feeding target cues into
the similarity search. Extensive evaluation performed on OTB-
2013/50/100 and VOT2018 benchmark datasets demonstrate the
proposed tracker outperforms state-of-the-art approaches while
maintaining real-time tracking speed.
